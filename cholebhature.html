                        <p>Chole Bhature is a quintessential Punjabi dish that represents the rich and robust flavors of North India. This hearty combination features spicy chickpea curry (chole) served with fluffy, deep-fried bread (bhature). The chickpeas are cooked in a tangy tomato-based gravy with aromatic spices, while the bhature are soft on the inside with a slightly crispy exterior. Often enjoyed as a filling breakfast or lunch, this dish is typically accompanied by pickled onions and green chilies. A favorite at street food stalls across Punjab and Delhi.</p>
